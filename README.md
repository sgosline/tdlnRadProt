# Mechanistic modeling of tumor draining lymph nodes
Integrative modeling of proteomics and radiomics of tumor draining lymph nodes.

## Data Module
We compile diverse data types to collect proteomics, radiomics, phosphoproteomics, and any other data that we may deem necessary.

## Analysis Module
This module will handle the comparisons and code.
